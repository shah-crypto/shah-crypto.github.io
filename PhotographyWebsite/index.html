                        <p class="card-text">Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or
                            universe.
                            "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The
                            study of
                            nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature,
                            human activity
                            is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena. The word nature is
                            borrowed
                            from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential
                            qualities, innate
                            disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura
                            is mostly
                            used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to
                            the
                            intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of
                            their own
                            accord.</p>

                            domesticated
                            descendant of the wolf. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey
                            wolf is the
                            dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by
                            hunter–gatherers
                            over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Their long association with
                            humans has led
                            dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior, leading to a large number of domestic
                            individuals and the
                            ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It
                            is the
                            only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat
                            to
                            distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm
                            cat or a
                            feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by
                            humans for
                            companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by
                            various cat
                            registries. The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong
                            flexible body,
                            quick reflexes, sharp teeth and tractable claws adapted to killing small prey.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">In human society, family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related
                            either by
                            consanguinity (by recognized birth) or affinity (by marriage or other relationship). The
                            purpose of
                            families is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society. Ideally, families
                            would offer
                            predictability, structure, and safety as members mature and participate in the community. In
                            most
                            societies, it is within families that children acquire socialization for life outside the
                            family, and
                            acts as the primary source of attachment, nurturing, and socialization for humans.</p>

                            characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high
                            metabolic
                            rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide
                            and range in
                            size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are
                            about ten
                            thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds
                            have wings
                            whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the
                            extinct moa
                            and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly,
                            although further
                            evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and

                            in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The
                            biological
                            function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the
                            union of
                            sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different
